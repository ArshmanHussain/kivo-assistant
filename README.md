"Kivo-Assistant"

This is Kivo, my Python voice assistant project. It listens when I say "kivo" and can open websites like Google, YouTube, Facebook, play songs on YouTube, and open the Visual Studio Code website. I’m planning to make it open the actual VS Code app soon.

What Kivo Can Do:

* Listen for the wake word “kivo”
* Open popular websites like Google, Facebook, YouTube Play any song on YouTube by just saying “play song [song name]”
* Open Visual Studio Code website (soon to open the app locally!)
*  Talk back using text-to-speech, so you know it’s working

How to use it:

* Make sure Python 3 is installed
* Install the libraries: SpeechRecognition, pyttsx3, pywhatkit
* Run the script
* Say "kivo" to wake it up, then give commands like "open google" or "play song [name]"

Why I built it:

I wanted to learn how voice assistants work with Python and have a simple helper for basic tasks. It’s a fun way to practice voice recognition and automation.

What’s next:

* Launch real desktop apps, not just websites
* Add more commands
* Improve listening accuracy
